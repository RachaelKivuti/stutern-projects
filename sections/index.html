            <strong><em>My name is Rachael Ngatha Kivuti.I have always been passionate about computers. My love for technology is that it's ever changing. I love technology because I believe in progress. People inevitably use technology to improve lives and help others. We spread knowledge and make tasks easier. I love technology because it's the triumph of the human intellect. The more I study and understand technology, the more I feel that nothing in the universe is out of reach. </em> </strong>

                I have learnt that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. HTML is the building block of a web page, that is, It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements such as tags and attributes. It is used in web development. <br> Css stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds. It helps us to control the text color, font style, the spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more.

            <strong><em>
                Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of your box. <br> Border is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above. <br> Margin is the outer space (or lack of space) surrounding the box.

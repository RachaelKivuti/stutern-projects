                <h3>ABOUT GITHERI</h3>
                <p>Githeri also called muthere or mutheri, is a Kenyan traditional meal of maize and legumes, mostly beans of any type mixed and boiled together.Githeri is the staple food of the Gikuyu, Meru, Mbeere people and Embu people in the Central Province and Eastern Province of Kenya, but it is also popular in other parts of the country and other communities, such as the Kamba people of Eastern province of Kenya.<br><br> The beans and maize can either be fresh or dry, but most people prefer fresh because it is much softer, and better tasting. It is easily accessible because maize and beans are readily available in these areas since they are mostly sourced directly from local farms and homesteads. <br><br>Githeri can also be made into a stew with the addition of vegetables and potatoes, and sometimes meat.Githeri is also used to make mukimo after the addition of potatoes, bananas, and greens, and mashing up the mixture. <br><br>Lately, there has been a rise in the popularity of Githeri due to the health benefits associated with the plant-based dish. One of the reasons for the popularity of beans and corn combination in diets worldwide is because they are both incomplete sources of amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.  Corn protein lacks some basic amino acids which beans have; while beans lack some basic amino acids, which corn have; hence why they complement each other well.</p>
